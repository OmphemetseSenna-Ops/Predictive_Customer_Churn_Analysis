# Predictive Customer Churn Analysis
This project focuses on a critical data analysis and machine learning initiative for Lloyds Banking Group (Forage). The core task involves exploring and analysing customer data to understand customer behavioural patterns, followed by the development of a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn. 

## Problem Statement
SmartBank, a significant subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group, is experiencing a concerning decline in customer retention, especially among young professionals and small business owners, which threatens its market position and revenue.

Senior management has called for a quick, data-driven approach to address this issue by focusing on two key questions:
- Firstly, what are the main behavioral, financial, and demographic factors that influence a customer's decision to leave? 
- Secondly, can we accurately identify which customers are most at risk of churning before they actually do?
