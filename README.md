# Lloyds Banking Group (Forage) - Churn Prediction | Analytics and Modeling
This project focuses on a critical data analysis and machine learning initiative for Lloyds Banking Group (Forage). The core task involves exploring and analysing customer data to understand customer behavioural patterns, followed by the development of a predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn. 

## Problem Statement
SmartBank, a significant subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group, is experiencing a concerning decline in customer retention, especially among young professionals and small business owners, which threatens its market position and revenue.

Senior management has called for a quick, data-driven approach to address this issue by focusing on two key questions:
- Firstly, what are the main behavioral, financial, and demographic factors that influence a customer's decision to leave? 
- Secondly, can we accurately identify which customers are most at risk of churning before they actually do?

## Repository Objective
The aim of this repository is to support a detailed data analysis and the development of a predictive model to better understand why customers leave Lloyds Banking Group’s SmartBank service. By identifying important behavioral factors, the project aims to create an accurate machine learning model that can predict which customers are most likely to stop using the service. This will help the bank take proactive steps to keep valuable customers and improve their overall satisfaction.
